                            To fuel my ambition to become a software developer I pursued a training course at _nology. The course provided rapid learning & application of
                            new coding languages, frameworks & libraries within a 12 week period. It's been a fantastic experience which has equipped me with the tools 
                            and exprience to kick start my career in tech. Click the icons to find out what I have been up to on the course...

                                            The learning that the _nology course provided has been intense and broad, pushing me out of my comfort zone and providing a challenge through each step 
                                            of the learning process. In such a short space of time I learned the JavaScript language in depth and also a broad swathe of JavaScript frameworks 
                                            and libraries. The course delved into the front-end framework of React and I applied the learning to our client project. I learned about JavaScript 
                                            back-end using Node.js and the use of Firebase applying the Firestore, cloud functions, hosting and authentication tools in my projects. 
                                            The course covered unit testing, CSS frameworks, git and package managers and to top that off there was a week dedicated to enhancing soft skills

                                            The course has given me the knowledge and confidence to build my own personal web applications outside of the course, helping me turn 
                                            my creative vision into something tangible, I can’t really convey how fantastic that is. Hopefully the effort and hard work I have put into to my learning and 
                                            development during the course will give me the ability to succeed in a career in tech.

                                        A large portion of the course was dedicated to the development of a progressive web application for a real-world client. Our project, 
                                        No.1 South East, was aimed at delivering a web service that provides its users with offers on food & drink from bars and restaurants across 
                                        London. The project front-end was developed using the React framework and leveraged Firebase for its backend services using the authentication, 
                                        databasing, hosting and cloud functions tools it provided. We made use of the Google Distance Matrix API to provide location/distance 
                                        based sorting of food & drink offers to the user. Personally, I was tasked with developing the admin functionality (primarily admin creation 
                                        using secure cloud functions), Firestore data creation and data retrieval throughout the web application, sign up functionality, offer code 
                                        generation, API functionality and other filtering features.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The project was developed using agile principles were individual project features were developed during weekly sprints. We utilised Trello boards 
                                        and daily stand ups to ensure our productivity was focused and remained high. We also ensured to maintained high levels of communication 
                                        throughout to prevent duplication of code and accidental breaking of the application during version-control branch merging. Overall, the team 
                                        worked exceptionally well together and I think we are proud of the product we produced. The practice of agile methods was a good experience and 
                                        gave us a glimpse into a software development style, we may encounter in our careers but as with all development methodologies it comes with 
                                        disadvantages which were also good to experience first-hand. In summation the client project has equipped me with the confidence and experience 
                                        to tackle similar team-based projects in the future.

                                        My next step will be into a tech related career, whether it be primarily front-end development or the full stack I'm eager to work 
                                        on problems which have solutions that benefit people and communities in some way. Software can be used to enhance and benefit society in so many ways,
                                        it impacts all industry sectors (I really can't think of an exception) and connects people around the world. I'd like to pursue a career in tech that adds 
                                        to the positivity and benefits software creates in our society.

                                        given me experience in developing projects in a tech environment. I have gained confidence in my ability to help and teach others and gained 
                                        inspiration to develop software that enhances the joy I get from my hobbies. Now it's time to take all my learning and put it into practice.

                                            Over the course of my university degree and career at Airbus team work has been the foundation of any work I have been involved in.
                                            The scope and complexity of eningeering problems cannot be tackled in isolation, it requires people of different backgrounds and 
                                            expertise to successfully develop a solution to any problem. No two people think the same and I genuinely believe this is what makes 
                                            team work fantastic. If we can bring together ideas, thoughts and inspiration from as many people as possible, draw on the knowledge 
                                            and experience of others all problems should be surmountable.

                                            My group at Airbus was classified as a support function which in essence means we were there to provide assistance to other departments. 
                                            Therefore my role required me to not just work with my immediate colleagues to design and implement fuel system models
                                            but also work closely with all other fuel systems teams; to understand their requirements, constraints, deliver data and
                                            analayses that enabled and supported their work. There was no shying away from team work it is the first and foremost skill
                                            required from any engineer.

                                        Problem solving, the bread and butter of engineering. Over my career at Airbus I have worked in a plethora of departments (primarily during
                                        my graduate scheme) dealing with some very unique and particular problems that require innovative solutions. These problems ranged from 
                                        those of a very partical basis, such as dealing with the maintenance and repairs on the Airbus flight test aircraft; to the abstract, dealing 
                                        with code based problems within the fuel systems modelling department. My time in reactive support even introduced time contrained problems 
                                        to the mix, related to in-service queries and AOG (Aircraft on Ground) requests from airlines with as little as 4 hours to find a solution to 
                                        get their aircraft back in-service as quickly as possible whilst ensuring no compromise to aircaft safety.

                                    <p>
                                        Overall I've developed a very broad knowledge of problem solving skills and a firm understanding of the methodology required to
                                        assess the problem and range of achievable solutions, understand what and how to obtain the information or data required, 
                                        creating an implementation plan and refining the workable solutions.
                                    </p>
                                    <P>
                                        Problem solving is what I enjoy most and is largely the reason I initially chose a career in engineering. However during my time in 
                                        the modelling & simluation team I realised I have a passion for pure logical type problems and is why I have chosen a change in career
                                        to persue a more coding/tech orientated path.

                                        For the majority of my Airbus career I worked in the fuel systems modelling & simulation department. As mentioned my responsibilities
                                        involved developing 1D thermal models of the aircraft fuel systems in order to validate the thermal performance (or flammability) 
                                        of the fuel tanks against the airwothiness authorities (FAA/EASA) certification requirements. The requirements demanded an analysis of the 
                                        aircraft's flammability on a fleet wide level (or minimum 10,000 flights) and a validation of the model used by comparing it with 
                                        flight test data. This required the implementation of numerical methods, mainly the monte carlo method, precision in the modelling physics
                                        employed and good methods of data handling and analysis. I can confidently say this role developed my knowledge in the aforementioned areas
                                        considerably in addition to developing strong coding practices and logic.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The other stream of work I was involved in was the development of the spatial models of the fuel tanks, in which we were tasked with
                                        modelling, to a high precision, the fuel tanks volume and inertial characteristics. These models required such high precision as they 
                                        were required to support fuel system guaging software, flight handling software and even flight simulator software. The fuel tank models 
                                        were also implemented in further design work and analysis such as the thermal analysis mentioned in the previous paragraph. This work 
                                        required the implementation of geometrical modelling and mathematical physics and demanded a high level of skill in data handling (i.e. there 
                                        were huge amounts!). I am proud to say I stepped up to this challenge and became the primary focal point for tank modelling tasks.

                            My hobbies are quite polarised between the silicon world and the natural one. I enjoy tinkering with electronics, creating apps 
                            and playing video games but also I am a proud owner of an allotment where I grow anything I can but honestly it's mostly tomatoes...

                                        A place of solace after a long hard day's work, a respite from the hustle and bustle of city life, an oasis in the pandemic's lockdown delirium, 
                                        that is allotment life and what a life it is! Aside from my passion pertaining to computers I've found joy in a non-silicon based and 100% natural 
                                        hobby that is vegetable growing (I prefer the term farming of course). I would advise it a hundred times over to anyone, it's great. And yes, I am 
                                        aware this makes me sound like I'm 60 years old but I don't care, when you take a bite of some sweetcorn freshly picked and barbequed within 10 
                                        minutes of harvesting, that sweet sweet taste will make any judgements evaporate into the summer air.

                                    <p>
                                        I have been an allotment owner now for 4 years, growing everything from cabbages to pumpkins (sorry did I mention tomatoes too? 
                                        always tomatoes...). The trials and tribulations are never ending but the rewards are exponentially greater. 
                                        It's a fantastic hobby that not only teaches you patience and perseverance but also drops you right at the heart of a community of 
                                        like-minded individuals eager to share growing tips and elbow grease, but more importantly their hard-grown vegetables (but only if you 
                                        share yours). It has some incredible benefits for both the body and mind and has been invaluable during the lockdown months.

                                    <p>
                                        I've said it already but will do again, try growing something, you won't regret it.

                                    <p>
                                        Returning to the world of tech, another hobby I've found interest in is building electronics. I mainly got involved in this to build an 
                                        environmental sensor and datalogger for my allotment. Whilst half of the hobby involves coding which is fantastic, the other side, 
                                        the building of the circuits appeals to my engineering mindset and the soldering can be quite calming and strangely therapeutic. 
                                        I say strangely here as it seems a little odd that it has a calming effect when you're essentially wielding an almost 400°C hot poker! 
                                        That aside, it is a rewarding hobby that ties nicely in with my passion for coding and really helps envision the potential and reach that 
                                        coding has.

                                        My final hobby of course would also be tech related. Gaming, where do I start? Normally I would hide my passion for gaming as in the past it 
                                        was seen quite negatively but with the rise of e-sports (now the most viewed "sport" in the world) it feels more comfortable to say I enjoy it. 
                                        Despite the obvious entertainment factor, gaming (more precisely online gaming) has the propensity to connect people across large distances, 
                                        bring them together through a shared purpose and rewards good team work with a shared joy of success, and of course, loot. As a medium one 
                                        of its more important features, especially in the current pandemic, is allowing me to stay connected to friends.
